Acknowledgments
Built with pytube (or yt-dlp, if applicable).
Thanks to the open-source community for providing amazing tools and libraries.
Customization Notes
Language/Frameworks: If the repository uses a specific language (e.g., Python, JavaScript) or library (e.g., pytube, yt-dlp, or a custom implementation), replace the placeholders with the actual ones used.
GUI vs CLI: If it has a graphical interface (e.g., using tkinter or PyQt), mention that in the "Usage" section and update the "Features" accordingly.
Additional Features: If the code supports playlists, audio-only downloads, or other features, add them to the "Features" list.
Actual File Names: Replace main.py with the actual entry point file name (e.g., downloader.py).
